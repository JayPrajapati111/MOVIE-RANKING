        This is my all time favorite movies and series. I love sci-fi movies the most because they take me to another world and make me think about the future. Interstellar is my top favorite movie because of its amazing storyline and visual effects. As for series, I enjoy watching dramas from different countries as they offer unique perspectives and storytelling styles. Death Note is my favorite anime because of its intriguing plot and complex characters.
